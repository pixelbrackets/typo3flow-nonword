Configuration
-------------

- The preferred way to install packages in TYPO3 Flow is through Composer (http://docs.typo3.org/flow/TYPO3FlowDocumentation/TheDefinitiveGuide/PartIII/PackageManagement.html#installing-a-package)
  Add the package to your existing TYPO3 Flow installation with the use of Composer:

	composer require pixelbrackets/nonword @dev

- Another way would be to download the package from the repository
  and save it into the folder »/Packages/Application/Pixelbrackets.NonWord/«
  (Note that package key & repository name differ)

- The package currently offers no further configuration options
